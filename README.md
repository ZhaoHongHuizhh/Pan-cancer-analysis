# Pan-cancer-analysis
## Code for visualization of pan-cancer analysis
Download LUAD 1038 data, BRCA 1099 data, BLCA 408 data, COAD 483 data from the TCGA website (https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga), through R programming software (https://www.r-project.org/), first according to The median expression of CDKN1A was divided into HIGH and LOW groups, and then genes with expression less than 1 were removed, and the DESeq2(https://github.com/mikelove/DESeq2)R package was used for differential analysis. GSEA enrichment analysis was performed using clusterProfiler (https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/clusterProfiler), which we then visualized based on NES and pvalue. All processing code is exposed (https://github.com/ZhaoHongHuizhh/Pan-cancer-analysis).
