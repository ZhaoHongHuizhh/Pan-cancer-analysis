# Pan-cancer-analysis
## Code for visualization of pan-cancer analysis
First, we used the GeneMANIA website (https://genemania.org) to find the 16 genes most closely related to the TFAP4 gene, and used the ChiPBase v 3.0 website (https://rnasysu.com/chipbase3/index.php) , looking for the pan-cancer expression correlation between TFAP4 and 16 genes, further using the String website (https://cn.string-db.org/) for enrichment analysis, and finally using the R language (https://www.r- project.org/) for mapping. We share code for visualization
